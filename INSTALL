Building depends on the CMake toolset, which you might need to install. 
You will also need the development packages for these libraries:

- QT
- ALSA
- pthread

To build and install the project, from this directory, follow these steps in a terminal:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr
  make

You can choose another install prefix, but this one is recommended for correct setup of
menu entry and man page.

Then, as root:

  make install

To uninstall, as root:

  make uninstall

Once installed, run the application from your "Audio/Multimedia" menu, or directly, by calling:

  px5deditor
