Main features missing (implemented soon):
------------------------------------------

* View & Dump of all presets in the unit. This is the most important feature
that shall be added to the next version. Currently the editor only shows the
current preset, allows to switch preset, but we have no global view of all the 
presets.

* Load & Save. Saving is implemented only on the current preset slot on the
unit. Being able to save to a different slot will be implemented next, as well
as saving and loading to two file formats: "Windows editor compatible" binary
format, and "Custom XML" format, which will be more open and allow to be
easily read by other tools.

* Drum machine. The PX5D has a really cool drum machine, and the drum machine
editor will be implemented soon.

* Separate building of lib and GUI.

* Use CPack to allow easy building of DEB and RPM packages.

* Further enhancements may be cool to have, especially features not available
on the Windows editor like changing preset number via a standard MIDI Program
Change command, linking MIDI controllers to some effect parameters, including
a tempo/delay time calculator, using the MIDI bass instrument of the PX5D to
output an audio tuner/reference, ... any ideas welcome!
